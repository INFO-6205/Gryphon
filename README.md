Gryphon Graph Library
=====================

Gryphon is a library for representing and traversing graphs.

The core concepts are in the package com.phasmidsoftware.gryphon.core.
As always, consult the spec files (under test directory) to learn how to use the library.

Edges
-----

There are three kinds of edges:

* undirected edge
* directed edge
* vertex pair

A vertex pair has no representation of its connection. Otherwise, undirected and directed edges are as you might expect.
